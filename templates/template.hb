Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
{{{docComments}}}
{{{signature}}}
```

{{{functionBody}}}

{{{snippets}}}

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
{{{code}}}
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.
